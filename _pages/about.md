Hi! I'm Gonçalo, a Machine Learning/NLP PhD student in the [DeepSPIN Project](https://deep-spin.github.io/), an ERC-funded research project coordinated by [Prof. André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/).

I did my MSc at The University of Edinburgh, having studied Artificial Intelligence. My [Master's thesis](https://github.com/goncalomcorreia/vqa_human_attention) was advised by [Prof. Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/) and was about using human attention as an additional supervision signal to improve the performance of a Visual Question Answering model.

I'm very passionate about Machine Learning and its applications. I am particularly interested in the fields of Representation Learning and Unsupervised Learning.
