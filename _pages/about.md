Hi! I'm Gonçalo, a Machine Learning/NLP PhD student in the <a href='https://deep-spin.github.io/' target='_blank'>DeepSPIN Project</a>, an ERC-funded research project coordinated by <a href='https://andre-martins.github.io/' target='_blank'>André Martins</a> and <a href='https://vene.ro/' target='_blank'>Vlad Niculae</a>.

I did my MSc at The University of Edinburgh, having studied Artificial Intelligence. My <a href='https://github.com/goncalomcorreia/vqa_human_attention' target='_blank'>Master's thesis</a> was advised by <a href='http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/' target='_blank'>Frank Keller</a> and was about using human attention as an additional supervision signal to improve the performance of a Visual Question Answering model.

I'm very passionate about Machine Learning and its applications. I am particularly interested in latent variable models, and unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.
